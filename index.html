            <p>
                Our team is a distinctive group of young men who are each hand-picked for their on-field talents and
                off-field display of character.
                Players are selected from across the state of Utah to showcase their abilities to NCAA, NAIA, and MCLA
                coaches at the highly competitive tournaments we attend.
                To be a member of Wasatch Lacrosse Club you must strive to play lacrosse at the highest level and always
                play selfless, with a team first mentality.
                You must also represent the community you live in and high school you attend with a sense of pride and
                responsibility.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Our mission is to provide a distinct advantage in College Recruiting to players on our club over other
                teams.
                We go the extra miles with filming our games, recording stats, clipping highlight films, emailing and
                calling college programs for you, and so on.
                Hard work, fun, and dedicated coaching are the foundation of Wasatch Lacrosse Club.
                Developing friendships between players and parents from various schools and communities are a key factor
                to the “Satch Lax” experience.

                            low key coaching style contributes to the cohesion among their teams and players. It is rare
                            that you see a highly competitive team that is comprised of a group of highly skilled
                            players that are unselfish and supportive of each other. The players selected to play on the
                            Wasatch teams are outstanding individuals and players.
                            Wasatch does an excellent job of recognizing and promoting their players and team on social
                            media and other outlets. Leadership starts at the top of any organization, including team
                            sports. These guys have the complete package, excellent coaches who understand and love the
                            game of lacrosse and also are great role models for their players. Playing for Wasatch has
                            been a great experience for my son, one that he will always remember.

                        <p>
                            The thing that stands out the most about Wasatch LC is the way that the team is managed. The
                            coaches genuinely care about my son's development and overall lacrosse experience. The
                            culture within the program is the best that I've seen. The players room, eat and play
                            together at tournaments which creates a strong sense of brotherhood. I've overheard several
                            of them wanting to spend time together outside of lacrosse and those friendships are what
                            make Wasatch LC such a unique experience. Parent communication is clear and concise and you
                            always know well in advance what to expect. The coaching is done at a very high level. I've
                            noticed a lot of improvement in my son's lacrosse IQ and stick skills.
                            Wasatch LC also does a great job of promoting the players on social media and we've already
                            started to receive a lot of recruiting interest. Thankfully, the coaches have also helped my
                            family to navigate that process! If you're looking for a positive lacrosse experience for
                            your son where he will receive top-notch coaching, increase his confidence, make a bunch of
                            new friends and greatly improve his lacrosse game, then look no further than Wasatch LC.

                            My son Christian has been playing lacrosse for over six years now and we have tried multiple
                            club programs. I typically go and watch all of the practices and all of the games. I am able
                            to evaluate the help he is getting and the progress he is making. Wasatch LC has been the
                            best decision by a landslide. This club is very positive and very focused on the improvement
                            and development of these boys. They are great about posting on social media and helping the
                            boys get recruited and feel good about themselves during the process. They have always been
                            very positive and their communication is very timely and proactive. You can tell that they
                            do it because they love the sport and not just as a business opportunity.

                            My son has benefited greatly from his participation with Wasatch. The coaching staff are not
                            only motivational but descriptive and instructional. Dylan is a kid who need's to understand
                            how things work, Amos, Danny, Ricky and Adam all dedicated extensive time toward this end.
                            What impresses me the most about Wasatch is the way in which they promote forward thinking.
                            If the team has a great game they acknowledge the success with a sound respect for looking
                            ahead to the next game. If the team struggles the coaches regroup and provide specific
                            direction as to how the boys can improve. Dylan will be playing college lacrosse this coming
                            year, he worked hard to get there and Wasatch worked right alongside him.
